Pinstagram
===================

Find the app at: https://pin-stagram-app.herokuapp.com

## Technology Used

*  Ruby on Rails
*  Rspec
*  Capybara
*  Devise
*  Postgresql
*  Carrierwave
*  Google Cloud Storage
*  Heroku

## Approach

* Due to a difficult week leading up to this challenge I was less familiar with Rails than I would have liked so instead of TDD I decided to explore the possibilities of leading development with experimentation and live feature testing. This is not an ideal process and one that I do not intend on repeating but I did enjoy myself nonetheless. 

* I wanted to link my file storage to a cloud service and through research found that it was a toss up between Amazon and Google. I choose to use Google as I have previously encountered AWS with my Alexa App.

* My main goal with the app was to have full functionality as dictated by Makers but to add my own styling using pure CSS and HTML. I have been consistently pushing myself to learn as much as possible without using libraries up to this point and I think it's given me a good grounding. I am looking forward to using libraries in the future.

## Functionality

A user can:
* Log In/Log Out and Sign Up
* Pin An image
* Comment on an image
* Delete a comment
* Like an image
* See how many likes an image has
* See if you have liked an image

## Future Possibilities

* AJAX
* Unlike an image
* Follow another user
* Tag a user in a comment
* Filter pins by likes/own images/followed etc
* Adding photo filters
